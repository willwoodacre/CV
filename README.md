# My CV
The current version of my CV.
I have included a pdf in the `/bin` directory, but you can also build it from the source by running `make`.
Making the CV requires the XeLatex compiler, as well as the fonts I have included in the `/fonts` directory.

The template is originally by Alessandro Plasmati (alessandro.plasmati@gmail.com).
